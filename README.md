This is Next.js 14 project. I'm using TailwindCSS for markup and Sanity, which is a headless, real-time content management system (CMS) that enables developers and content creators to manage digital content for websites and applications. It provides a flexible and structured approach to content management, allowing users to define their own content models and schemas.
